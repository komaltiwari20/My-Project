# Displaying Owncloud Access Files & Log History through an application interface on OWNCLOUD
Abstract:

Among the many cloud services, cloud object storage has perhaps experienced the most growth. It is commonly used for storing photographs, images, documents, and audio and video files. Every day, people find new uses for their favorite object store. Regardless of the purpose of the application you are developing, understanding cloud object storage services is an essential part of building a real-world, scalable solution.
ownCloud is a suite of client-server software for creating file hosting services and using them. ownCloud is functionally very similar to the widely used Dropbox, with the primary functional difference being that ownCloud is free and open-source, and thereby allowing anyone to install and operate it without charge on a private server. It also supports extensions that allow it to work like Google Drive, with online document editing, calendar and contact synchronization, and more. Its openness eschews enforced quotas on storage space or the number of connected clients, instead having hard limits (like on storage space or number of users) defined only by the physical capabilities of the server.
In this project,  an application on owncloud is build which will display the owncloud log files depending on the downloaded history.
